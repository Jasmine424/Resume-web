# Resume-web homework2
Hi everyone~ This is Simin Zhai's EC601homework Github demo. Welcome!!!

This is the first time for me to make a website, give it a domain and upload it to the personal serve. I am very excited! ^-^
By the way, I added the "chat with me" function in my personal website also.

I used some templates and CSS library of Bootstrap to make my website attracting and the chat function provided by firebase to enable people to communicate with me. Both of them are very useful and easy to start with.

This is the Trello link of my work schedule: https://trello.com/b/kr8t6Iwx/simin-zhai-ec601-homework2 

And welcome to my personal website: www.jasminefy.com

I am really willing to get some advice from you and make approvements in the future.

PS: Version 1.3 is the latest version and the final version for now.

Copyright: the template and CSS of Bootstrap, the chat function of firebase.
